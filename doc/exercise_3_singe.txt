The algorithm for exercise 3 was developed using Claude Sonnet 4.5. Initially a prompt was given to design and implement a single-objective evolutionary algorithm for monotone sub-modular problems with a uniform constraint. It was provided with the task sheet as reference material. This created an initial version of the code and the algorithm with four different diversity mechanisms: Fitness Sharing, Deterministic Crowding, Niching with Tournament Selection and Age-Based Diversity. Having these four different diversity mechanisms allowed me to experiment and find which worked optimally. 

As such problems 2100 through 2103 were run with all four different diversity mechanisms, and Fitness Sharing and Age-Based Diversity were found to be the best performers by a significant margin. As such these two were carried into the runs of problems 2200 through 2203 which took significantly longer to run.
